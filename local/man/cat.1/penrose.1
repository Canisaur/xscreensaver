       The _p_e_n_r_o_s_e program draws quasiperiodic tilings.

       See  Onoda,  Steinhardt,  DiVincenzo  and Socolar in Phys.
       Rev. Lett. 60, #25, 1988 or  Strandburg  in  Computers  in
       Physics, Sep/Oct 1991.

       This implementation uses the simpler version of the growth
       algorithm, i.e., if there are no forced vertices,  a  ran-
       domly chosen tile is added to a randomly chosen vertex (no
       preference for those 108 degree angles).

       There are two essential differences to the algorithm  pre-
       sented  in  the  literature:  First,  we  do not allow the
       tiling to enclose an untiled area.  Whenever  this  is  in
       danger  of  happening, we just do not add the tile, hoping
       for a better random choice the next  time.   Second,  when
       choosing  a  vertex  randomly,  we will take one that lies
       withing the viewport if available.  If this seems to cause
       enclosures  in the forced rule case, we will allow invisi-
       ble vertices to be chosen.

       Tiling is restarted whenever one of the following happens:
       there  are  no  incomplete vertices within the viewport or
       the tiling has extended a window's length beyond the  edge
       of  the  window  horizontally or vertically or forced rule
       choice has failed 100 times due to areas about  to  become
       enclosed.

       Although  quasiperiodic  tilings  are  produced, the tiles
       themselves are not penrose tiles  (darts  and  kites).  In
       contrast  to penrose tiles, these tiles can be arranged to
       form a periodic tiling.

       _p_e_n_r_o_s_e accepts the following options:

       --wwiinnddooww Draw on  a  newly-created  window.   This  is  the
               default.

       --rroooott   Draw on the root window.

               How  long (in 1/1,000,000'ths of a second) to wait
               between drawing each tile.  Default 10,000 or  .01
