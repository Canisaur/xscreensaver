       The _m_a_z_e program creates a "random" maze and  then  solves
       it with graphical feedback.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       _m_a_z_e accepts the following options:

       --wwiinnddooww Draw  on  a  newly-created  window.   This  is the
               default.

       --rroooott   Draw on the root window.

       --iinnssttaallll
               Install a private colormap for the window.

       --vviissuuaall _v_i_s_u_a_l
               Specify which visual to use.  Legal values are the
               name  of a visual class, or the id number (decimal
               or hex) of a specific visual.

       --ggrriidd--ssiizzee _p_i_x_e_l_s
               The size of each block of  the  maze,  in  pixels;
               default is 0, meaning pick a random grid size.

       --lliivvee--ccoolloorr _c_o_l_o_r
               The color of the path.

       --ddeeaadd--ccoolloorr _c_o_l_o_r
               The  color of the failed path (it is also stippled
               with a 50% pattern.)

       --ssoollvvee--ddeellaayy _i_n_t_e_g_e_r
               Delay (in microseconds) between each step  of  the
               solution  path.   Default  5000,  or about 1/200th
               second.

       --pprree--ddeellaayy _i_n_t_e_g_e_r
               Delay (in microseconds) between generating a  maze
               and starting to solve it.  Default 2000000 (2 sec-
               onds.)

       --ppoosstt--ddeellaayy _i_n_t_e_g_e_r
               Delay (in microseconds) after solving a  maze  and

               before  generating  a new one.  Default 4000000 (4
               seconds.)

       Clicking the mouse in the maze window controls it.

       LLeeffttBBuuttttoonn      Clears the window and restarts maze.

       MMiiddddlleeBBuuttttoonn    Pause or unpause the program.

       RRiigghhttBBuuttttoonn     Exit.

BBUUGGSS
       Expose events force a restart of maze.

       Mouse actions are based on "raw" values (Button1,  Button2
       and Button3) instead of using the pointer map.

EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT
       DDIISSPPLLAAYY to get the default host and display number.

       XXEENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT
               to  get the name of a resource file that overrides
               the global resources stored in  the  RESOURCE_MAN-
