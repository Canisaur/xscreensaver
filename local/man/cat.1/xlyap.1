       _x_l_y_a_p  generates and graphically displays an array of Lya-
       punov exponents for a  variety  of  iterated  periodically
       forced non-linear maps of the unit interval.

       -random A  good  choice  for  use with xscreensaver: picks
               random parameters from a built-in list.

       -C _n    Specifies the minimum color index to be  used  for
               negative exponents

       -D _n    Specifies the "dwell" or number of iterations over
               which to average in order to  calculate  the  Lya-
               punov exponent. Default is 400.

       -B      Causes  the  stop, go, spin and quit buttons to be
               displayed.

       -H _n    Specifies the height of  the  window.  Default  is
               256.

       -L      Indicates use log(x) + log(y) rather than log(xy).

       -M _r    Specifies the real value to compare exponent  val-
               ues  to  for  indexing  into  a  color  wheel. The
               default value is 1.0.

       -O _n    Specifies the minimum color index to be  used  for
               positive exponents

       -R _p    Specifies pseudo-random forcing with probability _p
               of using parameter value 'a'.

       -S _n    Specifies the "settle"  or  number  of  iterations
               prior  to  the beginning of the calculation of the
               Lyapunov exponent. Default is 200.

       -W _n    Specifies the width of the window. Default is 256.

       -a _r    Specifies  the  real  value  to use as the minimum
               parameter value of the horizontal axis. Default is
               3.0 for the logistic map.

       -b _n    Specifies  the  real  value  to use as the minimum



                                                                1





XLYAP(6X)                                               XLYAP(6X)


               parameter value of the vertical axis.  Default  is
               3.0 for the logistic map.

       -c _n    Selects  one of six different color wheels to use.
               The default color wheel is a rainbow palette.

       -F _1_0_1_0_1_0_1_0
               Specifies the "Function" forcing function to  use.
               The  example above would alternate between iterat-
               ing the circle and logistic maps. An  argument  of
               "-F  2323"  would alternate between left and right
               logistic maps. The default is to only use the sin-
               gle specified map (see the description of -m).

       -f _a_b_b_a_b_a_a_b
               Specifies the forcing function to use. The default
               is to alternate between the "a" parameter and  the
               "b" parameter.

       -h _r    Specifies  the  real value to be used as the range
               over which the vertical parameter values vary. The
               default is 1.0.

       -i _r    Specifies  the real value of the initial condition
               to use. Default is 0.05.

       -m _n    Selects between available non-linear maps  of  the
               unit interval. A value of 0 specifies the logistic
               map. A value of 1, the circle map. A value  of  2,
               the  left-logistic. A value of 3, the right-logis-
               tic.  A  value  of  4,  the  double-logistic.  The
               default is 0, the logistic map.

       -o _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e
               Specifies  the  output filename to be used. If the
               -o option is given, this file  will  automatically
               be  written  out at the completion of the drawing.
               If it is not  specified,  a  default  filename  of
               lyap.out  is  used  and only written if the 'f' or
               'F' keys are pressed during a run. The  format  of
               the  output  file  is  PPM  for  color and PGM for
               monochrom. The parameters used  to  calculate  the
               picture  are included as comments at the beginning
               of the output file.

       -p      Switches color indices for negative  and  positive
               exponents. Generally, causes negative exponents to
               be displayed in more detail  while  darkening  and
               narrowing  the color range for positive exponents.
               This can be toggled during runtime by pressing the
               'p' key.

       -r _n    Specifies  the  maximum  rgb  value  to  be  used.
               Default is 35000.



                                                                2

       -v      Prints out the  various  values  to  be  used  and
               exits.

       -w _r    Specifies  the  real value to be used as the range
               over which the horizontal parameter  values  vary.
               The default is 1.0.

       -x _n    Specifies  the  x  screen coordinate of the window
               (default is 256).

       -y _n    Specifies the y screen coordinate  of  the  window
               (default is 256).

       select the area to be investigated  with  the  mouse.  The
       upper left hand corner of the desired area is the location
       of the cursor when the button is pressed. The lower  right
       hand  corner is specified by the cursor when the button is
       released.

       The algorithm was taken from the September 1991 Scientific
       American  article  by  A.  K.  Dewdney who gives credit to
       Mario Markus of the Max Planck Institute for its creation.
       Additional  information  and  ideas  were gleaned from the
       discussion on  alt.fractals  involving  Stephen  Hall,  Ed
       Kubaitis, Dave Platt and Baback Moghaddam. Assistance with
       colormaps and spinning color wheels and X was gleaned from
       Hiram  Clawson.  Rubber  banding  code was adapted from an
       existing Mandelbrot program written by Stacey Campbell.
