       The  _s_l_i_p  program  does  lots  of blits and chews up your
       screen image.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       _s_l_i_p accepts the following options:

       --wwiinnddooww Draw on  a  newly-created  window.   This  is  the
               default.

       --rroooott   Draw on the root window.

       --mmoonnoo   If   on  a  color  display,  pretend  we're  on  a
               monochrome display.

       --iinnssttaallll
               Install a private colormap for the window.

       --vviissuuaall _v_i_s_u_a_l
               Specify which visual to use.  Legal values are the
               name  of a visual class, or the id number (decimal
               or hex) of a specific visual.

       --nnccoolloorrss _i_n_t_e_g_e_r
               How many colors  should  be  used  (if  possible).
               Default  128.   The  colors used cycle through the
               hue, making N stops around the color wheel.

       --ccoouunntt _i_n_t_e_g_e_r
               How many whooziwhatsis to generate.  Default 35.

       --ccyycclleess _i_n_t_e_g_e_r
               How long to frobnicate.  Default 50.

       --ddeellaayy _m_i_c_r_o_s_e_c_o_n_d_s
               How long we should wait between drawing each step.
               Default 50000, or about 1/20th second.


RREESSOOUURRCCEESS
       On  some systems (currently, only SGIs), this program can,
       instead of grabbing a desktop image, grab a frame of video
       from  an external camera and manipulate that instead.  The
       following resources control that.

       ggrraabbVViiddeeooPPrroobbaabbiilliittyy (Float)
               What portion of the time to grab video rather than
               a  screen image, between 0.0 and 1.0.  Defaults to
               0.5, or half the time.

       vviiddeeooDDeevviiccee (Integer)
               The number of the default video  input  device  to
               check  first.   If unspecified, the default camera
               (from videopanel(1)) will be checked first.  After
               that, all other available video input devices will
               be checked in order.

               The first one which  produces  a  non-black  image
               will be used.  If all images are black, the others
               will be re-checked a few times  before  giving  up
               and  falling  back  to  simply  grabbing a desktop
               image (but note that this takes a few seconds,  so
               if  you  don't  actually  have  any  video sources
               hooked up, you should consider turning  off  video
               grabbing  by setting ggrraabbVViiddeeooPPrroobbaabbiilliittyy to 0.0.)

       vviiddeeooGGaaiinn (Float)
               The amount by which to brighten the grabbed image.
               This defaults to 2.2.

EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT
       DDIISSPPLLAAYY to get the default host and display number.

       XXEENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT
               to  get the name of a resource file that overrides
               the global resources stored in  the  RESOURCE_MAN-
               AGER property.
