       The  _c_r_i_t_i_c_a_l  program displays a self-organizing critical
       system that gradually emerges from chaos.

       _c_r_i_t_i_c_a_l performs a simulation on a two-dimensional  array
       of  integers.   The array is initialized to random values.
       On each iteration, it draws a line to the  array  position
       with  the  greatest value.  It then replaces that location
       and the eight neighboring locations with randomly-selected
       values.

       The  lines  are  initially random, but over time a chaotic
       self-organizing system evolves: areas of the screen  which
       happen  to have lower values are less likely to be updated
       to new values, and so the line tends to avoid those areas.
       Eventually, the histogram of changes approaches the power-
       law curve typical of such systems.

       The simplest documented self-organizing system is the one-
       dimensional equivalent of _c_r_i_t_i_c_a_l.

       I heard about this algorithm second-hand: apparently there
       was an article in _S_c_i_e_n_t_i_f_i_c _A_m_e_r_i_c_a_n describing it  some-
       time in 1997.

       _c_r_i_t_i_c_a_l accepts the following options:

       --wwiinnddooww Draw  on  a  newly-created  window.   This  is the
               default.

       --rroooott   Draw on the root window.

       --mmoonnoo   If  on  a  color  display,  pretend  we're  on   a
               monochrome display.

       --iinnssttaallll
               Install a private colormap for the window.

       --vviissuuaall _v_i_s_u_a_l
               Specify which visual to use.  Legal values are the
               name of a visual class, or the id number  (decimal
               or hex) of a specific visual.
