       Time  3D  is  a clock. It uses flying balls to display the
       time. This balls move and wobble around to  give  you  the
       impression  your graphic workstation with its many XStones
       is doing something.

       t3d uses mouse and keyboard to let  you  fly  through  the
       balls. Hit SS to speed up, AA to slow down, ZZ to zoom in and
       XX to zoom out.  Use the lleefftt mmoouussee bbuuttttoonn to rotate to the
       left  and the rriigghhtt mmoouussee bbuuttttoonn to rotate the view to the
       right. Use the mmiiddddllee mmoouussee bbuuttttoonn to change  the  optical
       axis and the moving direction.  00 (zero) will stop you.  QQ
       quits.

       --mmoovvee _f_a_c_t_o_r
              Modifies the direction move of t3d. The clock looks
              30  degrees*  _f_a_c_t_o_r  to  the left and to the right
              periodically.

       --wwoobbbbllee _f_a_c_t_o_r
              Modifies the wobbling (sounds nice :-)  of  t3d  by
              multiplying  the  default  deformation of the clock
              with _f_a_c_t_o_r_.

       --mmiinnuutteess
              Shows one small ball for every minute,  instead  of
              one for every 2.5 minutes.

       --mmaagg _f_a_c_t_o_r
              Changes  the  magnification of t3d. By default, t3d
              draws a 200x200 image.  A .I factor of 2 means,  it
              will use a 400x400 image.

       --ccyyccllee _p_e_r_i_o_d
              Sets   the  moving  cycle  to  _p_e_r_i_o_d  seconds.  By
              default, this value is 10 seconds.

       --wwaaiitt _m_i_c_r_o_s_e_c
              Inserts a wait after drawing one view of the clock.
              By  default,  t3d  waits  40 ms after each drawing.
              This helps you to keep the performance loss  small.

       --ffaasstt _p_r_e_c_a_l_c___r_a_d_i_u_s
              t3d  uses  bitmap copy to draw precalculated balls.
              You can specify the radius in pixels  up  to  which
              t3d  should  precalculate  balls.  t3d  will  set a

              useful range by itself using the magnification when
              it is started.

       --ccoollccyyccllee
              Draws  cyclic the color scale used for the balls in
              the background instead of the normal black.

       --rrggbb _r_e_d _g_r_e_e_n _b_l_u_e
              Selects the color in RGB color space of the  light-
              ning  spot on the balls.  All the other colors used
              for balls or --ccoollccyyccllee are less intensive colors of
              the same hue and saturation. All values in range of
              0 to 1.

       --hhssvv _h_u_e _s_a_t_u_r_a_t_i_o_n _v_a_l_u_e
              Selects the color in HSV color space.   _h_u_e  is  in
              degrees  from  0  to 360, all other values in range
              from 0 to 1. It gives nice but rather unpredictable
              results, if you use a saturation of e.g. 2.  Try it
              at your own risk.

       --hhssvvccyyccllee _s_p_e_e_d
              Rotates the hue axis every 10 seconds* _s_p_e_e_d_.

       --hheellpp  Prints a short usage message.

       T3D is  not  related  to  T3D(tm),  the  massive  parallel
       Alpha--based  supercomputer from Cray Research. T3D's name
       was invented in 1991, years before  the  project  at  Cray
       Research  started. There is no relation from T3D to Cray's
       T3D, even  the  balls  surrounding  T3D  on  some  posters
       weren't  an  inspiration  for  T3D.  I don't know anything
       about the other way round.

       The programming style of T3D isn't intented as example  of
       good  style,  but as example of how a fast prototyped demo
       may look like. T3D wasn't created to  be  useful,  it  was
       created to be nice.

       There are no known bugs in T3D. Maybe there are bugs in X.
       Slight changes in the T3D sources are known to show  these
       bugs, e.g. if you remove the (int) casting at the XFillArc
       x,y,w,h-coordinates...
