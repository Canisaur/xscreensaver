       The _v_i_d_w_h_a_c_k_e_r program grabs a  image  from  the  system's
       video  input, applies random image filters to it, and dis-
       plays the result.  The _v_i_d_w_h_a_c_k_e_r program does not  termi-
       nate  until  killed.   It depends heavily on xxvv(1) and the
       various PBM tools (e.g., ppppmmrreelliieeff(1).)

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       _v_i_d_w_h_a_c_k_e_r accepts the following options:

       --rroooott   Draw on the root window.

       --wwiinnddooww Pop up a new window displaying the image.  When  a
               new  image  has been fully processed, destroy that
               window and pop up a new one.  This is the default.

       --vveerrbboossee
               Print diagnostics.

       --ssttddiinn  Instead  of  grabbing  an  image from the system's
               video input, read an  image  to  maniupulate  from
               stdin.  This image must be in

       --ddeellaayy _s_e_c_o_n_d_s
               How  long to sleep between images.  Default 3 sec-
               onds (the actual  elapsed  time  is  significantly
               longer,  due  to processing time.)  ppppmm(5) format.
               The program will  still  perform  repeated  random
               image transformations, but it will always use this
               one image as its starting point.

       --ssttddoouutt Instead of displaying the image on a window or  on
               the root, write the new image on stdout, and exit.

               the  global  resources stored in the RESOURCE_MAN-

       Grabbing video images is, of  course,  very  system-depen-
       dent.   It  works  on SGIs, and on Linux systems that have
       the qqccaamm(1) program.  If your system does  things  differ-
       ently, you'll need to edit the vidwhacker script (look for

       It's slow.

       It might be interesting to rewrite  this  to  use  ggiimmpp(1)
       plugins instead of the pbm tools.  It probably wouldn't be
       any faster, but there would be a wider variety of  effects
       available.
