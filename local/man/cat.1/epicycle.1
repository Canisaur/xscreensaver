       The  epicycle program draws the path traced out by a point
       on the edge of a circle.  That  circle  rotates  around  a
       point  on  the  rim  of another circle, and so on, several
       times.  The random curves produced can be simple  or  com-
       plex, convex or concave, but they are always closed curves
       (they never go in indefinitely).

       You can configure both the way the curves  are  drawn  and
       the  way in which the random sequence of circles is gener-
       ated, either with command-line options or X resources.

       --ccoolloorrss _N
               How many colors should be used (if possible).  The
               colors are chosen randomly.

               line segments of the path.   If you do not specify
               --ssyynncc, some X servers may batch up several drawing
               operations  together,  producing  a  less   smooth
               effect.     This  is  more  likely  to  happen  in
               monochrome mode (on  monochrome  servers  or  when
               --mmoonnoo is specified).

               Width in pixels of the body's track.    Specifying
               values  greater than one may cause slower drawing.
               The fastest value is  usually  zero,  meaning  one
               pixel.

       --mmiinn__cciirrcclleess _N

               olution of the epicycles.  The  actual  speeds  of
               the  epicycles  vary from this down to _m_i_n___s_p_e_e_d _/

       --ttiimmeesstteepp _n_u_m_b_e_r
               Decreasing this value will reduce the distance the
               body moves for each line segment, possibly produc-
               ing  a smoother figure.  Increasing it may produce
               faster results.

               Each epicycle rotates at a rate which is a  factor
               of  the base speed.  The speed of each epicycle is
               the base speed divided by some integer  between  1
               and  the  value  of  the  --hhaarrmmoonniiccss option.  This
               integer is decided by starting at 1 and tossing  a
               biased coin.  For each consecutive head, the value
               is incremented by one.  The integer  will  not  be
               incremented  above  the  value  of  the --hhaarrmmoonniiccss
               option.  The argument of this option  decides  the
               bias  of the coin; it is the probability that that
               coin will produce a head at any given toss.

       --ssiizzee__ffaaccttoorr__mmiinn _n_u_m_b_e_r
               Epicycles are always at least this factor  smaller
               than their parents.

       --ssiizzee__ffaaccttoorr__mmaaxx _n_u_m_b_e_r

               than their parents.

       Before the drawing of the figure is begun,  a  preliminary
       calculation  of  the  path  is  done in order to scale the
       radii of the epicycles so as to  fit  the  figure  on  the
       screen or window.  For the sake of speed, This calculation
       is done with a larger timestep than  the  actual  drawing.
       The  time-step  used  is the value of the --ttiimmeesstteepp option
       multiplied  by  the  timestepCoarseFactor  resource.   The

       The  program  runs  mostly without user interaction.  When
       running on the root window, no input  is  accepted.   When
       running  in its own window, the program will exit if mouse
       button 3  is  pressed.   If  any  other  mouse  button  is
       pressed,  the current figure will be abandoned and another
       will be started.

HHIISSTTOORRYY
       The geometry of epicycles was perfected by  Hipparchus  of
       Rhodes  at  some time around 125 B.C., 185 years after the
       birth of Aristarchus of Samos, the inventor of the  helio-
       centric  universe  model.  Hipparchus applied epicycles to
       the Sun and the Moon.  Ptolemy of Alexandria  went  on  to
       apply  them to what was then the known universe, at around
       150 A.D.  Copernicus went on to apply them to  the  helio-
       centric  model  at the beginning of the sixteenth century.
       Johannes Kepler discovered that the planets actually  move
       in  elliptical  orbits  in about 1602.  The inverse-square
       law of gravity was suggested by Boulliau in  1645.   Isaac
       Newton's  _P_r_i_n_c_i_p_i_a _M_a_t_h_e_m_a_t_i_c_a was published in 1687, and
       proved that Kepler's laws derived from Newtonian  gravita-
       tion.

       The  colour  selection  is re-done for every figure.  This
       may generate too much network traffic for this program  to
       work well over slow or long links.
