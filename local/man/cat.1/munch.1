       The _m_u_n_c_h program preforms the munching squares hack until
       killed.   It picks square size, position, and gravity ran-
       domly; configurable options are listed below.

       The munching squares hack cosists of drawing Y = X  XOR  T
       for  a range of X and T over and over until all the possi-
       ble combinations of X and T have come up.  It was  report-
       edly  discovered  by  Jackson  Wright  in  1962 and took 5
       instructions of PDP-6 code.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       _m_u_n_c_h accepts the following options:

       --wwiinnddooww Draw on  a  newly-created  window.   This  is  the
               default.

       --rroooott   Draw on the root window.

       --mmoonnoo   If   on  a  color  display,  pretend  we're  on  a
               monochrome display.

       --iinnssttaallll
               Install a private colormap for the window.

       --vviissuuaall _v_i_s_u_a_l
               Specify which visual to use.  Legal values are the
               name  of a visual class, or the id number (decimal
               or hex) of a specific visual.

       --ddeellaayy _s_e_c_o_n_d_s
               How long to wait before starting over.  Default  5
               seconds.

       --xxoorr    Use the XOR drawing function.  (Default.)

       --nnoo--xxoorr Don't use the XOR drawing function.

       --sshhiifftt  Start drawing the square at weird starting points.
               (Default.)

       --nnoo--sshhiifftt
               Don't shift and start drawing the square at  weird
               starting points.

       ITEM 146: MUNCHING SQUARES
               Another simple display program. It is thought that
               this  was  discovered by Jackson Wright on the RLE
               PDP-1 circa 1962.

               operations other than  XOR,  and  rotations  other
               than  -22.  (Try  IOR; AND; TSC; FADR; FDV(!); ROT

       ITEM 147 (Schroeppel):
               Munching squares is just views of the graph Y =  X
               XOR T for consecutive values of T = time.

               A  modification  to munching squares which reveals
               them in frozen states through opening and  closing
