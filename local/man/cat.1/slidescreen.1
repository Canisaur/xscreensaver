       The _s_l_i_d_e_s_c_r_e_e_n program takes  an  image  of  the  screen,
       divides  it  into  a grid, deletes a random square of that
       grid, and then randomly slides one  of  the  neighbors  of
       this "hole" into the hole (and repeat.)

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       _s_l_i_d_e_s_c_r_e_e_n accepts the following options:

       --wwiinnddooww Draw  on  a  newly-created  window.   This  is the
               default.

       --rroooott   Draw on the root window.

       --iinnssttaallll
               Install a private colormap for the window.

       --vviissuuaall _v_i_s_u_a_l
               Specify which visual to use.  Legal values are the
               name  of a visual class, or the id number (decimal
               or hex) of a specific visual.

       --ggrriidd--ssiizzee _p_i_x_e_l_s
               The size of the grid cells.  Default 70 pixels.

       --iibbww _p_i_x_e_l_s
               The size  of  the  "gutter"  between  grid  cells.
               Default 1 pixel.

       --iinnccrreemmeenntt _p_i_x_e_l_s
               How  many  pixels by which a piece should be moved
               when sliding to a new location.  Default  10  pix-
               els.

       --ddeellaayy _m_i_c_r_o_s_e_c_o_n_d_s
               How  much  of a delay should be introduced between
               steps of the animation of the motion of each  seg-
               ment.  Default 50000, which is 0.05 seconds.  This
               is closely related to the _-_i_n_c_r_e_m_e_n_t parameter.

       --ddeellaayy _m_i_c_r_o_s_e_c_o_n_d_s
               How much of a delay should be  introduced  between
               the  end  of  the  motion  of  one segment and the
               beginning  of  the  motion  of  another.   Default
               1000000, which is one second.

       On  some systems (currently, only SGIs), this program can,
       instead of grabbing a desktop image, grab a frame of video
       from  an external camera and manipulate that instead.  The
       following resources control that.


       ggrraabbVViiddeeooPPrroobbaabbiilliittyy (Float)
               What portion of the time to grab video rather than
               a  screen image, between 0.0 and 1.0.  Defaults to
               0.5, or half the time.

       vviiddeeooDDeevviiccee (Integer)
               The number of the default video  input  device  to
               check  first.   If unspecified, the default camera
               (from videopanel(1)) will be checked first.  After
               that, all other available video input devices will
               be checked in order.

               The first one which  produces  a  non-black  image
               will be used.  If all images are black, the others
               will be re-checked a few times  before  giving  up
               and  falling  back  to  simply  grabbing a desktop
               image (but note that this takes a few seconds,  so
               if  you  don't  actually  have  any  video sources
               hooked up, you should consider turning  off  video
               grabbing  by setting ggrraabbVViiddeeooPPrroobbaabbiilliittyy to 0.0.)

       vviiddeeooGGaaiinn (Float)
               The amount by which to brighten the grabbed image.
               This defaults to 2.2.

EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT
       DDIISSPPLLAAYY to get the default host and display number.

       XXEENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT
               to  get the name of a resource file that overrides
               the global resources stored in  the  RESOURCE_MAN-
               AGER property.
