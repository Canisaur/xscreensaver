       The _s_l_i_d_e_s_c_r_e_e_n program takes  an  image  of  the  screen,
       divides  it  into  a grid, deletes a random square of that
       grid, and then randomly slides one  of  the  neighbors  of
       this "hole" into the hole (and repeat.)

       _s_l_i_d_e_s_c_r_e_e_n accepts the following options:

       --wwiinnddooww Draw  on  a  newly-created  window.   This  is the
               default.

       --rroooott   Draw on the root window.

       --iinnssttaallll
               Install a private colormap for the window.

       --vviissuuaall _v_i_s_u_a_l
               Specify which visual to use.  Legal values are the
               name  of a visual class, or the id number (decimal
               or hex) of a specific visual.

       --ggrriidd--ssiizzee _p_i_x_e_l_s
               The size of the grid cells.  Default 70 pixels.

       --iibbww _p_i_x_e_l_s
               The size  of  the  "gutter"  between  grid  cells.
               Default 1 pixel.

       --iinnccrreemmeenntt _p_i_x_e_l_s
               How  many  pixels by which a piece should be moved
               when sliding to a new location.  Default  10  pix-
               els.

       --ddeellaayy _m_i_c_r_o_s_e_c_o_n_d_s
               How  much  of a delay should be introduced between
               steps of the animation of the motion of each  seg-
               ment.  Default 50000, which is 0.05 seconds.  This
               is closely related to the _-_i_n_c_r_e_m_e_n_t parameter.

       --ddeellaayy _m_i_c_r_o_s_e_c_o_n_d_s
               How much of a delay should be  introduced  between
               the  end  of  the  motion  of  one segment and the
               beginning  of  the  motion  of  another.   Default
               1000000, which isone second.
