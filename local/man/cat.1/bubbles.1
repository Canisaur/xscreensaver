       _B_u_b_b_l_e_s sprays lots of little random bubbles all over  the
       window which then grow until they reach their maximum size
       and go pop.  The inspiration for this was watching  little
       globules  of oil on the bottom of a frying pan and it also
       looks a little like bubbles  in  fizzy  soft  drink.   The
       default  mode  uses  fancy ray-traced bubbles but there is
       also a mode which just draws circles in case  the  default
       mode is too taxing on your hardware.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       Depending on how your _b_u_b_b_l_e_s was compiled, it accepts the
       following options:

       --ffoorreeggrroouunndd
               Colour of circles if _-_s_i_m_p_l_e mode is selected.

       --bbaacckkggrroouunndd
               Colour of window background.

       --wwiinnddooww Draw on  a  newly-created  window.   This  is  the
               default.

       --rroooott   Draw on the root window.

       --mmoonnoo   If   on  a  color  display,  pretend  we're  on  a
               monochrome display.

       --iinnssttaallll
               Install a private colormap for the window.

       --vviissuuaall _v_i_s_u_a_l
               Specify which visual to use.  Legal values are the
               name  of a visual class, or the id number (decimal
               or hex) of a specific visual.

       --ddeellaayy mmiiccrroosseeccoonnddss
               How much of a delay should be  introduced  between
               steps  of  the  animation.   Default 1, or about 1
               microsecond.  Actually, this is the delay  between
               each  group  of  15 new bubbles since such a delay
               between each step results in a very slow animation
               rate.

       --nnooddeellaayy
               Same as _-_d_e_l_a_y _0.

       --ssiimmppllee Don't  use the default fancy pixmap bubbles.  Just
               draw circles instead.  This may give more bearable
               performance  if your hardware wasn't made for this
               sort of thing.

       --bbrrookkeenn Don't hide bubbles when they pop.  This was a  bug
               during  development  but the results were actually
               quite attractive.  (This option is only  available
               if  you  have  the  XPM  library available and the
               imake generated Makefile has defined HAVE_XPM).

       --33DD     Normally, the simulation is done completely in two
               dimensions.   When  a  bubble  swallows up another
               bubble, the areas of each are  added  to  get  the
               area of the resulting bubble.  This option changes
               the algorithm to  instead  add  volume  (imagining
               each to be a sphere in 3D space).  The whole thing
               looks more realistic but I find it attracts atten-
               tion  to the flickering of each bubble as they are
               move and are redrawn.  Your mileage may vary.

       --ffiillee ffiilleennaammee
               Use the pixmap  definitions  in  the  given  file,
               instead  of  the  default (if one is compiled in).
               This is ignored if _-_s_i_m_p_l_e is specified.   If  the
               file is compressed (either with compress or gzip),
               it is decompressed before use.  (This option  only
               works  if  you  have XPM compiled into your binary
               and you have compiled with BUBBLES_IO set in  bub-
               bles.h.  This is nnoott the default).

       --ddiirreeccttoorryy ddiirreeccttoorryynnaammee
               Similar to _-_f_i_l_e except the file is taken randomly
               from the  contents  of  the  specified  directory.
               (Again,  this option is only available if you have
               XPM and BUBBLES_IO was set  when  compiling.   See
               above).

       --qquuiieett  Don't print messages explaining why one or several
               command line options were ignored.  This  is  dis-
               abled by default.

NNOOTTEESS
       If  you  find  the  pace of things too slow, remember that
       there is a delay even though you specify no _-_d_e_l_a_y option.
       Try using _-_n_o_d_e_l_a_y although beware of the effects of irri-
       tation of other users if you're on a shared system as  you
       bleed their CPU time away.

       Some  tools  to  assist  in  creation  of  new bubbles are
       included in the source distribution.  These can either  be

       loaded with the _-_f_i_l_e or _-_d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y options (if available)
       or they can be used in place of  the  distributed  default
       bubble  (bubble_default.c).   You might like to copy these
       scripts to a permanent location and use them.   Read  bub-
       bles.README.

       Rendered bubbles are not supported on monochrome displays.
       I'm not convinced that small bubbles, even dithered  prop-
       erly are going to look like anything more than a jumble of
       random dots.

BBUUGGSS
       There is a delay before something appears  on  the  screen
       when  using  rendered  bubbles.   The XPM library seems to
       take a lloonngg time to make pixmaps out of  raw  data.   This
       can be irritating on slower systems.

       The  movement  of the bubbles looks jerky if an incomplete
       set of bubbles is used.

       The hide/display algorithm could  do  with  some  work  to
       avoid flickering when _-_n_o_d_e_l_a_y is set.
