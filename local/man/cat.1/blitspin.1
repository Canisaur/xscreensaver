       The _b_l_i_t_s_p_i_n program repeatedly rotates  a  bitmap  by  90
       degrees by using logical operations: the bitmap is divided
       into quadrants, and the quadrants are  shifted  clockwise.
       Then  the  same  thing  is  done  again with progressively
       smaller quadrants, except  that  all  sub-quadrants  of  a
       given  size  are  rotated  in  parallel.   So  this  takes
       OO((1166**lloogg22((NN)))) blits of size NxN, with the limitation  that
       the  image must be square, and the size must be a power of
       2.

       _b_l_i_t_s_p_i_n accepts the following options:

       --wwiinnddooww Draw on  a  newly-created  window.   This  is  the
               default.

       --rroooott   Draw on the root window.

       --mmoonnoo   If   on  a  color  display,  pretend  we're  on  a
               monochrome display.

       --iinnssttaallll
               Install a private colormap for the window.

       --vviissuuaall _v_i_s_u_a_l
               Specify which visual to use.  Legal values are the
               name  of a visual class, or the id number (decimal
               or hex) of a specific visual.

       --bbiittmmaapp _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e
               The file name of a bitmap to rotate.  It need  not
               be  square:  it will be padded with the background
               color.  If unspecified or the string _(_d_e_f_a_u_l_t_),  a
               builtin bitmap is used.

               If support for the _X_P_M library was enabled at com-
               pile-time, the specified file may be in _X_P_M format
               as well as _X_B_M, and thus may be a color image.

               The  **bbiittmmaappFFiilleePPaatthh  resource will be searched if
               the bitmap name is not a fully-qualified pathname.
