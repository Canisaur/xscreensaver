       The _b_l_i_t_s_p_i_n program repeatedly rotates  a  bitmap  by  90
       degrees by using logical operations: the bitmap is divided
       into quadrants, and the quadrants are  shifted  clockwise.
       Then  the  same  thing  is  done  again with progressively
       smaller quadrants, except  that  all  sub-quadrants  of  a
       given  size  are  rotated  in  parallel.   So  this  takes
       OO((1166**lloogg22((NN)))) blits of size NxN, with the limitation  that
       the  image must be square, and the size must be a power of
       2.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       _b_l_i_t_s_p_i_n accepts the following options:

       --wwiinnddooww Draw on  a  newly-created  window.   This  is  the
               default.

       --rroooott   Draw on the root window.

       --mmoonnoo   If   on  a  color  display,  pretend  we're  on  a
               monochrome display.

       --iinnssttaallll
               Install a private colormap for the window.

       --vviissuuaall _v_i_s_u_a_l
               Specify which visual to use.  Legal values are the
               name  of a visual class, or the id number (decimal
               or hex) of a specific visual.

       --bbiittmmaapp _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e
               The file name of a bitmap to rotate.  It need  not
               be  square:  it will be padded with the background
               color.  If unspecified or the string _(_d_e_f_a_u_l_t_),  a
               builtin bitmap is used.

               If support for the _X_P_M library was enabled at com-
               pile-time, the specified file may be in _X_P_M format
               as well as _X_B_M, and thus may be a color image.

               The  **bbiittmmaappFFiilleePPaatthh  resource will be searched if
               the bitmap name is not a fully-qualified pathname.

               is spun will be grabbed from the  portion  of  the
               screen  underlying  the  blitspin window.  (Or, it
               may  come  from  an  external  video  source:  see
               below.)


       --ddeellaayy _m_i_c_r_o_s_e_c_o_n_d_s
               How  long  to  delay between steps of the rotation
               process, in microseconds.  Default is 500000, one-
               half second.


       --ddeellaayy22 _m_i_c_r_o_s_e_c_o_n_d_s
               How long to delay between each 90-degree rotation,
               in microseconds.  Default is 500000, one-half sec-
               ond.   DDIISSPPLLAAYY to get the default host and display
               number.

       On some systems (currently, only SGIs), this program  can,
       instead of grabbing a desktop image, grab a frame of video
       from an external camera and manipulate that instead.   The
       following resources control that.


       ggrraabbVViiddeeooPPrroobbaabbiilliittyy (Float)
               What portion of the time to grab video rather than
               a screen image, between 0.0 and 1.0.  Defaults  to
               0.5, or half the time.

       vviiddeeooDDeevviiccee (Integer)
               The  number  of  the default video input device to
               check first.  If unspecified, the  default  camera
               (from videopanel(1)) will be checked first.  After
               that, all other available video input devices will
               be checked in order.

               The  first  one  which  produces a non-black image
               will be used.  If all images are black, the others
               will  be  re-checked  a few times before giving up
               and falling back  to  simply  grabbing  a  desktop
               image  (but note that this takes a few seconds, so
               if you  don't  actually  have  any  video  sources
               hooked  up,  you should consider turning off video
               grabbing by setting ggrraabbVViiddeeooPPrroobbaabbiilliittyy to  0.0.)

       vviiddeeooGGaaiinn (Float)
               The amount by which to brighten the grabbed image.
               This defaults to 2.2.

EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT
       XXEENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT to get the name of a resource file that over-
       rides  the global resources stored in the RESOURCE_MANAGER
       property.
