       The  _d_e_c_a_y_s_c_r_e_e_n  program creates a melting effect by ran-
       domly shifting rectangles around the screen.

       _d_e_c_a_y_s_c_r_e_e_n accepts the following options:

       --wwiinnddooww Draw on  a  newly-created  window.   This  is  the
               default.

       --rroooott   Draw on the root window.

       --mmoonnoo   If   on  a  color  display,  pretend  we're  on  a
               monochrome display.

       --iinnssttaallll
               Install a private colormap for the window.

       --vviissuuaall _v_i_s_u_a_l
               Specify which visual to use.  Legal values are the
               name  of a visual class, or the id number (decimal
               or hex) of a specific visual.

       --ddeellaayy _m_i_c_r_o_s_e_c_o_n_d_s
               Slow it down.

       --mmooddee _m_o_d_e
               The direction in which the image  should  tend  to
               slide.   Legal  values  are  _r_a_n_d_o_m  (meaning pick
               one), _u_p, _l_e_f_t,  _r_i_g_h_t,  _d_o_w_n,  _u_p_l_e_f_t,  _d_o_w_n_l_e_f_t,
               _u_p_r_i_g_h_t,  _d_o_w_n_r_i_g_h_t,  _s_h_u_f_f_l_e  (meaning  perfer no
               particular direction),  _i_n  (meaning  move  things
               toward  the center), _o_u_t (meaning move things away
               from the  center),  _m_e_l_t  (meaning  melt  straight
               downward), and _s_t_r_e_t_c_h (meaning stretch the screen
               downward).

RREESSOOUURRCCEESS
       On some systems (currently, only SGIs), this program  can,
       instead of grabbing a desktop image, grab a frame of video
       from an external camera and manipulate that instead.   The
       following resources control that.


       ggrraabbVViiddeeooPPrroobbaabbiilliittyy (Float)
               What portion of the time to grab video rather than

               a screen image, between 0.0 and 1.0.  Defaults  to
               0.5, or half the time.

       vviiddeeooDDeevviiccee (Integer)
               The  number  of  the default video input device to
               check first.  If unspecified, the  default  camera
               (from videopanel(1)) will be checked first.  After
               that, all other available video input devices will
               be checked in order.

               The  first  one  which  produces a non-black image
               will be used.  If all images are black, the others
               will  be  re-checked  a few times before giving up
               and falling back  to  simply  grabbing  a  desktop
               image  (but note that this takes a few seconds, so
               if you  don't  actually  have  any  video  sources
               hooked  up,  you should consider turning off video
               grabbing by setting ggrraabbVViiddeeooPPrroobbaabbiilliittyy to  0.0.)

       vviiddeeooGGaaiinn (Float)
               The amount by which to brighten the grabbed image.
               This defaults to 2.2.

EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT
       DDIISSPPLLAAYY to get the default host and display number.

       XXEENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT
               to get the name of a resource file that  overrides
               the  global  resources stored in the RESOURCE_MAN-
               AGER property.
