       The _x_s_c_r_e_e_n_s_a_v_e_r_-_d_e_m_o program is a graphical front-end for
       setting the parameters used  by  the  background  xxssccrreeeenn--
       ssaavveerr(1) daemon.  It is essentially two things: a tool for
       editing the _~_/_._x_s_c_r_e_e_n_s_a_v_e_r file; and a tool  for  demoing
       the  various  graphics  hacks that the _x_s_c_r_e_e_n_s_a_v_e_r daemon
       will launch.

       The main dialog box contains  a  scrolling  list,  a  text
       field, and a number of buttons.

       Double-clicking  on  one  of the programs in the list will
       run it.  The screen will go black, and  the  program  will
       run  in full-screen mode, just as it would if the _x_s_c_r_e_e_n_-
       _s_a_v_e_r daemon had launched it.  Clicking  the  mouse  again
       will  stop  the  demo  and un-blank the screen, making the
       dialog box visible again.

       Single-clicking in the list will place the indicated  pro-
       gram  and  its  args in the text field to be edited.  Edit
       the arguments and hit return to run the program  with  the
       parameters  you  have specified.  This will also save your
       changes to your _~_/_._x_s_c_r_e_e_n_s_a_v_e_r file: so any  changes  you
       make in this way are persistent.

       If  one of the lines in the scrolling list begins with the
       character "-", then that means that the  program  is  dis-
       abled:  _x_s_c_r_e_e_n_s_a_v_e_r  will not select it to be run (though
       you can still try it out by clicking on it.)  Rather  than
       just  deleting  the  programs  you  don't want to run, you
       might want to disable them in this way  instead,  so  that
       you can more easily change your mind later.

       If  the line begins with the name of a visual, followed by
       a colon, then that program will only be run on  that  kind
       of visual.  For example, you can specify that a particular
       program should only be run  if  color  is  available,  and
       another should only be run in monochrome.  See the discus-
       sion of the _p_r_o_g_r_a_m_s parameter in the  _C_o_n_f_i_g_u_r_a_t_i_o_n  sec-
       tion of the xxssccrreeeennssaavveerr(1) manual.

       The buttons are:

       RRuunn NNeexxtt
               Clicking  this button will run the next program in
               the list after  the  currently-selected  one,  and

               This  pops  up  a  second dialog box, in which you
               have the option to interactively  change  most  of
               the  screensaver's operational parameters, such as
               its timeouts,  and  whether  it  should  lock  the
               screen.   When  you click OK, your chosen settings
               will take effect immediately,  and  will  also  be
               saved  to  the  _~_/_._x_s_c_r_e_e_n_s_a_v_e_r  file in your home
               directory, so that the settings will persist  next
               time.

               ground _x_s_c_r_e_e_n_s_a_v_e_r daemon will  continue  running
               as before.

       The  Preferences  dialog box lets you change the following
       settings.

       (There are more settings available, but these are the most
       commonly used ones; see the manual for xxssccrreeeennssaavveerr(1) for
       other  parameters  that  can  be  set   by   editing   the
       _~_/_._x_s_c_r_e_e_n_s_a_v_e_r file, or the X resource database.)

       SSaavveerr TTiimmeeoouutt
               After  the  user  has  been  idle  this  long, the
               _x_s_c_r_e_e_n_s_a_v_e_r daemon will blank the screen.

       CCyyccllee TTiimmeeoouutt
               After the screensaver has been  running  for  this
               long,  the currently running graphics demo will be
               killed, and a new one started.  If this is 0, then
               the  graphics demo will never be changed: only one
               demo will run until the screensaver is deactivated
               by user activity.

               Whether to print lots of debugging information.

       IInnssttaallll CCoolloorrmmaapp
               Whether  to  install  a private colormap while the
               screensaver is active, so that the graphics  hacks
               can  get  as  many colors as possible.  (This only
               applies when the screen's default visual is  being
               used, since non-default visuals get their own col-
               ormaps automatically.)  This can also be  overrid-
               den on a per-demo basis.

       FFaaddee CCoolloorrmmaapp
               If  selected, then when the screensaver activates,
               the current contents of the screen  will  fade  to
               black  instead  of  simply winking out.  This only
               works on displays with  writable  colormaps,  that
               is,  if  the  screen's default visual is a Pseudo-
               Color visual.  A  fade  will  also  be  done  when
               switching  graphics  hacks (when the _C_y_c_l_e _T_i_m_e_o_u_t
               expires.)

       UUnnffaaddee CCoolloorrmmaapp
               The complement to _F_a_d_e _C_o_l_o_r_m_a_p: if selected, then
               when  the  screensaver  deactivates,  the original
               contents of the screen will  fade  in  from  black
               instead of appearing immediately.  This only works
               on displays with writable colormaps, and when _F_a_d_e
               _C_o_l_o_r_m_a_p is also selected.

       FFaaddee DDuurraattiioonn
               When  fading  or  unfading are selected, this con-
               trols how long the fade will take.

       FFaaddee TTiicckkss
               This controls how many times a second the colormap
               will  be changed to effect a fade.  Higher numbers
               yield smoother fades, but may make the fades  take
               longer  than  the  specified number of seconds, if
               your server isn't fast enough to keep up.

       RReeqquuiirree PPaasssswwoorrdd
               Whether the screen saver should  lock  the  screen
               when it activates.

       LLoocckk TTiimmeeoouutt
               If _R_e_q_u_i_r_e _P_a_s_s_w_o_r_d is selected, this controls the
               length of the ``grace period''  between  when  the
               screensaver activates, and when the screen becomes
               locked.  For example,  if  this  is  0:05:00,  and
               _S_a_v_e_r  _T_i_m_e_o_u_t  is 0:10:00, then after 10 minutes,
               the screen would blank.  If there was user  activ-
               ity  at  12 minutes, no password would be required
               to un-blank the screen.  But, if  there  was  user
               activity  at  15  minutes  or later (that is, _L_o_c_k
               _T_i_m_e_o_u_t minutes after activation) then a  password
               would be required.  The default is 0, meaning that
               if locking is enabled, then  a  password  will  be
               required as soon as the screen blanks.

       PPaasssswwoorrdd TTiimmeeoouutt
               When  the screensaver is prompting for a password,
               the prompt dialog box will stay on the screen  for
               this  long  before  giving  up,  and  reverting to
               screen-saving mode.

               also  control the _x_s_c_r_e_e_n_s_a_v_e_r daemon that is man-
