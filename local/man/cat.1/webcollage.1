       The _w_e_b_c_o_l_l_a_g_e program pulls random image off of the World
       Wide  Web  and scatters them on the root window.  It finds
       these images by doing random web searches, and  extracting
       images  from  the returned pages.  It places the images on
       the root window  by  using  the  xxvv(1),  ggiiffttooppnnmm(1),  and
       ddjjppeegg(1) tools.

       _w_e_b_c_o_l_l_a_g_e also works as a CGI program: simply make a sym-
       bolic link to the _w_e_b_c_o_l_l_a_g_e executable called _n_p_h_-_w_e_b_c_o_l_-
       _l_a_g_e_._c_g_i.   If this program sees that it is being run as a
       CGI, then it will behave  appropriately.   (The  generated
       web  page  will  list the images one after another, rather
       than tiling them together.)

       _w_e_b_c_o_l_l_a_g_e is written in ppeerrll(1) and requires Perl 5.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       _w_e_b_c_o_l_l_a_g_e accepts the following options:

       --rroooott   Draw on the root window.  This  option  is  mandi-
               tory: drawing to a window other than the root win-
               dow is not yet supported.

       --vveerrbboossee or --vv
               Print diagnostics to stderr.  Multiple _-_v switches
               increase  the amount of output.  _-_v will print out
               only the URLs of the images; _-_v_v  will  print  all
               the  commands  being run; and _-_v_v_v will print more
               than you care about.

       --ddeellaayy _s_e_c_o_n_d_s
               How long to sleep between images.  Default 1  sec-
               ond.   (Remember that this program probably spends
               a lot of time waiting for the network.)

       --bbaacckkggrroouunndd _c_o_l_o_r_-_o_r_-_p_p_m
               What to use for the background onto  which  images
               are pasted.  This may be a color name, a hexadeci-
               mal RGB specification in the  form  '#rrggbb',  or
               the name of a PPM file.

       --ttiimmeeoouutt _s_e_c_o_n_d_s
               How long to wait for a URL to complete before giv-
               ing up on it  and  moving  on  to  the  next  one.

               Default 30 seconds.

       --ffiilltteerr _c_o_m_m_a_n_d
               Filter  all  source  images  through this command.
               The command must take a PPM  file  on  stdin,  and
               write  a  new PPM file to stdout.  One good choice
               for a filter would be:

                    webcollage -root -filter 'vidwhacker -stdin -stdout'


       --ffiilltteerr22 _c_o_m_m_a_n_d
               Filter the _c_o_m_p_o_s_i_t_e image through  this  command.
               The  _-_f_i_l_t_e_r option applies to the sub-images; the
               _-_f_i_l_t_e_r_2 applies to the final, full-screen  image.

               the global resources stored in  the  RESOURCE_MAN-
               AGER property.

BBUUGGSS
       When  drawing  on  the  root  window,  it  always uses the
       default colormap.  This is actually a  limitation  of  xv.
       But regardless, when using this program with xscreensaver,
       it must be given the ddeeffaauulltt--nn visual  specification  (see
       the xxssccrreeeennssaavveerr(1) manual for more details.)

       Only the GIF and JPEG image formats are supported.

       Transparent and animating GIFs are not supported.

       It's slow.
