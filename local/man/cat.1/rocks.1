DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       The _r_o_c_k_s program draws an animation of an asteroid  field
       moving  past  the observer (or vice versa).  Sometimes the
       observer picks up spin on Z axis.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       _r_o_c_k_s accepts the following options:

       --wwiinnddooww Draw on  a  newly-created  window.   This  is  the
               default.

       --rroooott   Draw on the root window.

       --mmoonnoo   Make all the rocks the same color.

       --nnccoolloorrss ccoolloorrss
               How  many  different  colors  to  use.  Default 5.
               Colors are chosen randomly.

       --iinnssttaallll
               Install a private colormap for the window.

       --vviissuuaall _v_i_s_u_a_l
               Specify which visual to use.  Legal values are the
               name  of a visual class, or the id number (decimal
               or hex) of a specific visual.

       --ccoouunntt _i_n_t_e_g_e_r
               Maximum number of rocks to draw on the  screen  at
               once.  Default 100.

       --ssppeeeedd _i_n_t_e_g_e_r
               A measure of the speed with which the observer and
               the rocks pass each other, from 1 to 100.  Default
               100,  meaning  ``very fast.''  If you're on a slow
               display connection  (the  animation  looks  jerky)
               then   try  making  this  number  smaller,  and/or
               decreasing the number of rocks.

       --ddeellaayy _m_i_c_r_o_s_e_c_o_n_d_s
               Number  of  microseconds  to  delay  between  each
               frame.   Default  50000, meaning about 1/20th sec-
               ond.  Compare and contrast with _-_s_p_e_e_d, above.

       --nnoorroottaattee
               Don't rotate the observer; just  fly  through  the
               field on the level.

       --nnoommoovvee Don't  turn  the observer; just fly straight ahead
               through the field.

       --33dd     Do red/blue 3d separations: if  you  look  at  the
               screen  with 3d glasses, the rocks will be _j_u_m_p_i_n_g
               right _o_u_t at you.  Oooooh, scaaary!

               to get the name of a resource file that  overrides
               the  global  resources stored in the RESOURCE_MAN-

       There should be an option  to  display  doppler  shift  (a
       gravity rainbow.)

       Speed of rotation should be settable.

       Default  speed  of  rotation should be relative to forward
       velocity.
