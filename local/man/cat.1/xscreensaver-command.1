       --hheellpp   Prints a brief summary of command-line options.

       --ddeemmoo   Cause  the  screensaver  to  enter its interactive
               demo mode, in which one can  experiment  with  the
               various  graphics  hacks  available.  See xxssccrreeeenn--
               ssaavveerr(1) for details.

       --aaccttiivvaattee
               Tell the screensaver to turn on immediately  (that
               is,  pretend  that  the  user  been  idle for long
               enough.)  It will turn off as soon as there is any
               user activity, as usual.

               It is useful to run this from a menu; you may wish
               to run it as

                    sleep 5 ; xscreensaver-command -activate

               to be sure that you have time to remove your  hand
               from the mouse before the screensaver comes on.

       --ddeeaaccttiivvaattee
               Tell  the screensaver to turn off, as if there had
               been user activity.  If locking is  enabled,  then
               the  screensaver  will  prompt  for  a password as
               usual.

       --lloocckk   Like _-_a_c_t_i_v_a_t_e, but a password  will  be  required
               before  the  screensaver  turns  off,  even if the
               screensaver's _l_o_c_k resource is false.  The display
               will  be  locked  immediately  even if the screen-
               saver's _l_o_c_k_T_i_m_e_o_u_t resource is non-zero.

       --ccyyccllee  Tell the screensaver to change which graphics hack
               it  is running, just as if the ``cycle'' timer had
               expired.  A new hack will be chosen randomly.

       --nneexxtt   This is like either _-_a_c_t_i_v_a_t_e or _-_c_y_c_l_e, depending

               on  which  is  more  appropriate,  except that the
               screenhack that will be run is the next one in the
               list  of  programs,  instead  of a randomly-chosen
               one.  Repeatedly executing this will cycle through
               each  hack  in turn (though using the _-_d_e_m_o option
               is probably an easier way to accomplish that.)

       --pprreevv   This is like _-_n_e_x_t, but cycles in the other direc-
               tion.

       --eexxiitt   Causes the screensaver process to exit gracefully.
               This is a safer and easier way to kill the screen-
               saver than by using _k_i_l_l.

               WWaarrnniinngg:: never use _k_i_l_l _-_9 with _x_s_c_r_e_e_n_s_a_v_e_r while
               the screensaver is active.  If  you  are  using  a
               virtual root window manager, that can leave things
               in an inconsistent state,  and  you  may  need  to
               restart  your window manager to repair the damage.

       --rreessttaarrtt
               Causes the screensaver process to  exit  and  then
               restart  with  the  same  command  line arguments.
               This is a good way of causing the  screensaver  to
               re-read the resource database.

               If the screensaver is run from _x_d_m_(_1_) (that is, it
               is already running before you log in) then you may
               want  to issue the ``restart'' command from one of
               your startup scripts, so that the screensaver gets
               your  resource  settings  instead  of  the default
               ones.

       --vveerrssiioonn
               Print  (on  stdout)  the  version  number  of  the
               xscreensaver  program that is running on $DISPLAY.
               (To see the version number of _x_s_c_r_e_e_n_s_a_v_e_r_-_c_o_m_m_a_n_d
               itself, use the _-_h_e_l_p option.)

       --ttiimmee   This option prints on stdout the time at which the
               screensaver last activated (blanked the screen) or
               deactivated  (restored the screen.)  Note that the
               activation-time is not the last time at which  the
               user was active, but is some time later (it is the
               time at which either:  xscreensaver  decided  that
               the  user  has been idle long enough; or, the user
               explicitly activated the screensaver or locker.)
