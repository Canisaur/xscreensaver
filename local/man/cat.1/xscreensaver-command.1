       The   _x_s_c_r_e_e_n_s_a_v_e_r_-_c_o_m_m_a_n_d   program  controls  a  running
       _x_s_c_r_e_e_n_s_a_v_e_r process by sending it client-messages.

       xxssccrreeeennssaavveerr(1) has a client-server  model:  the  xscreen-
       saver  process is a daemon that runs in the background; it
       is  controlled  by  other  foreground  programs  such   as
       _x_s_c_r_e_e_n_s_a_v_e_r_-_c_o_m_m_a_n_d and xxssccrreeeennssaavveerr--ddeemmoo(1).

       This program, _x_s_c_r_e_e_n_s_a_v_e_r_-_c_o_m_m_a_n_d, is a command-line-ori-
       ented tool; the xxssccrreeeennssaavveerr--ddeemmoo(1).  program is a graph-
       ical tool.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       _x_s_c_r_e_e_n_s_a_v_e_r_-_c_o_m_m_a_n_d  accepts  the  following command-line
       options:

       --hheellpp   Prints a brief summary of command-line options.

       --ddeemmoo   This just launches the  xxssccrreeeennssaavveerr--ddeemmoo(1)  pro-
               gram, in which one can experiment with the various
               graphics hacks available, and edit parameters.

       --ddeemmoo _n_u_m_b_e_r
               When the _-_d_e_m_o option is followed by  an  integer,
               it  instructs  the _x_s_c_r_e_e_n_s_a_v_e_r daemon to run that
               hack, and wait for the user  to  click  the  mouse
               before  deactivating  (i.e., mouse motion does not
               deactivate.)   This  is  the  mechanism  by  which
               xxssccrreeeennssaavveerr--ddeemmoo(1)    communicates    with   the
               xxssccrreeeennssaavveerr(1) daemon.  (The first  hack  in  the
               list is numbered 1, not 0.)

       --pprreeffss  Like  the no-argument form of _-_d_e_m_o, but brings up
               that program's Preferences panel by default.

       --aaccttiivvaattee
               Tell xscreensaver to turn on immediately (that is,
               blank the screen, as if the user had been idle for
               long enough.)  The screensaver will deactivate  as
               soon as there is any user activity, as usual.

               It is useful to run this from a menu; you may wish




X Version 11             20-Jun-99 (3.15)                       1





XScreenSaver(1)                                   XScreenSaver(1)


               to run it as

                    sleep 5 ; xscreensaver-command -activate

               to be sure that you have time to  take  your  hand
               off  the  mouse  before  the screensaver comes on.
               (Because if you  jiggle  the  mouse,  xscreensaver
               will notice, and deactivate.)

       --ddeeaaccttiivvaattee
               If  the  screensaver  is  active  (the  screen  is
               blanked), this command will deactivate it just  as
               if  there had been keyboard or mouse activity.  If
               locking is  enabled,  then  the  screensaver  will
               prompt for a password as usual.

       --ccyyccllee  If  the  screensaver  is  active  (the  screen  is
               blanked), then stop the current graphics demo  and
               run a new one (chosen randomly.)

       --nneexxtt   This is like either _-_a_c_t_i_v_a_t_e or _-_c_y_c_l_e, depending
               on which is  more  appropriate,  except  that  the
               graphics  hack that will be run is the next one in
               the list, instead of a  randomly-chosen  one.   In
               other words, repeatedly executing -next will cause
               the xscreensaver process to invoke  each  graphics
               demo sequentially.  (Though using the _-_d_e_m_o option
               is probably an easier way to accomplish that.)

       --pprreevv   This is like _-_n_e_x_t, but cycles in the other direc-
               tion.

       --sseelleecctt _n_u_m_b_e_r
               Like  _-_a_c_t_i_v_a_t_e,  but  runs the _Nth element in the
               list of hacks.  By knowing what is in the _p_r_o_g_r_a_m_s
               list, and in what order, you can use this to acti-
               vate the screensaver with  a  particular  graphics
               demo.   (The first element in the list is numbered
               1, not 0.)

       --eexxiitt   Causes the xscreensaver  process  to  exit  grace-
               fully.   This  is  roughly the same as killing the
               process with kkiillll(1), but it is easier, since  you
               don't need to first figure out the pid.

               WWaarrnniinngg:: never use _k_i_l_l _-_9 with _x_s_c_r_e_e_n_s_a_v_e_r while
               the screensaver is active.  If  you  are  using  a
               virtual root window manager, that can leave things
               in an inconsistent state,  and  you  may  need  to
               restart  your window manager to repair the damage.

       --lloocckk   Tells the running xscreensaver process to lock the
               screen  immediately.   This is like _-_a_c_t_i_v_a_t_e, but
               forces locking as well, even if locking is not the

               default  (that  is,  even  if  xscreensaver's _l_o_c_k
               resource is false, and  even  if  the  _l_o_c_k_T_i_m_e_o_u_t
               resource is non-zero.)

               Note that locking doesn't work unless the _x_s_c_r_e_e_n_-
               _s_a_v_e_r process is running  as  you.   See  xxssccrreeeenn--
               ssaavveerr(1) for details.

       --tthhrroottttllee
               Temporarily  switch  to ``blank screen'' mode, and
               don't run any display  modes  at  all,  until  the
               screensaver  is next de-activated.  This is useful
               if you're using a machine remotely, and  you  find
               that some display modes are using too much CPU.

               (If  you want to do this _p_e_r_m_a_n_e_n_t_l_y, that is, you
               want the screen saver to only blank the screen and
               not  run  demos  at  all,  then  set  the _p_r_o_g_r_a_m_s
               resource to an empty  list:   See  xxssccrreeeennssaavveerr(1)
               for details.)

       --uunntthhrroottttllee
               Turn `-throttle' mode off and resume normal behav-
               ior.

       --vveerrssiioonn
               Prints the version of xscreensaver  that  is  cur-
               rently running on the display: that is, the actual
               version number of the running  xscreensaver  back-
               ground  process, rather than the version number of
               xscreensaver-command.  (To see the version  number
               of  _x_s_c_r_e_e_n_s_a_v_e_r_-_c_o_m_m_a_n_d  itself,  use  the  _-_h_e_l_p
               option.)

       --ttiimmee   Prints the time  at  which  the  screensaver  last
               activated  or  deactivated  (roughly, how long the
               user has been idle or  non-idle:  but  not  quite,
               since  it  only  tells  you when the screen became
               blanked or un-blanked.)

       --rreessttaarrtt
               Causes the screensaver process to  exit  and  then
               restart  with  the  same command line arguments as
               last time.   Do  this  after  you've  changed  the
               resource database, to cause xscreensaver to notice
               the changes.

               WWaarrnniinngg:: if you have a  _._x_s_c_r_e_e_n_s_a_v_e_r  file,  this
               might  not  do  what  you expect.  You're probably
               better off killing the existing xscreensaver (with
               _x_s_c_r_e_e_n_s_a_v_e_r_-_c_o_m_m_a_n_d  _-_e_x_i_t) and then launching it
               again.

               The important point is, you need to make sure that

               the  xscreensaver  process  is running as you.  If
               it's not, it won't be reading the right  _._x_s_c_r_e_e_n_-
