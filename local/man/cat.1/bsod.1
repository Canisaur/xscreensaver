       The _b_s_o_d program is the finest in personal computer emula-
       tion.

       _b_s_o_d steps through a set of screens, each one a recreation
       of  a different failure mode of an operating system.  Sys-
       tems depicted include Microsoft's Windows 95  and  Windows
       NT, Commodore-Amiga's AmigaDOS 1.3, SPARC Linux, SCO UNIX,
       the Apple Macintosh (both the  MacsBug  debugger  and  the
       rarer "Sad Mac"), and the Atari ST.


OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       _b_s_o_d accepts the following options:

       --wwiinnddooww Draw  on  a  newly-created  window.   This  is the
               default.

       --rroooott   Draw on the root window.

       --mmoonnoo   If  on  a  color  display,  pretend  we're  on   a
               monochrome display.

       --iinnssttaallll
               Install a private colormap for the window.

       --vviissuuaall _v_i_s_u_a_l
               Specify which visual to use.  Legal values are the
               name of a visual class, or the id number  (decimal
               or hex) of a specific visual.

       --ddeellaayy _d_e_l_a_y
               The   delay   between  displaying  one  crash  and
               another.

EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT
       DDIISSPPLLAAYY to get the default host and display number.

       XXEENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT
               to get the name of a resource file that  overrides
               the  global  resources stored in the RESOURCE_MAN-
               AGER property.

XX RREESSOOUURRCCEESS
       Notable X resources supported include the following, which
       control  which  hacks  are  displayed  and  which  aren't.

       ddooWWiinnddoowwss,  ddooNNTT,  ddooAAmmiiggaa,   ddooMMaacc,   ddooMMaaccssBBuugg,   ddooSSCCOO,
       ddooAAttaarrii,  and  ddooSSppaarrccLLiinnuuxx.   Each  of these is a Boolean
       resource, they all default to  true,  except  for  doSpar-
       cLinux  and  doAtari,  which  are  turned  off by default,
       because they're really not all  that  interesting  looking
       unless  you're  a fan of those systems.  There aren't com-
       mand-line options for these, so  to  change  them,  you'll
       need  to  add  entries to your .Xdefaults file, or use the
       -xrm option.  For example, to tell bsod not to show the NT
       crash:

            bsod -xrm '*doNT: false'


BBUUGGSS
       Unlike the systems that the images are borrowed from, _b_s_o_d
       does not require a reboot after running.

       _b_s_o_d should also emulate more systems,  but  systems  with
       interesting  crash graphics are not as common as one might
       hope.

       One I'd really like to see is a Unix system getting a ker-
       nel panic, rebooting, and running ffsscckk(8).
