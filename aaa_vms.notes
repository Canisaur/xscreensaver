OpenVMS port of Xscreensavser version 1.26     December 1995
==========================================

Xscreensaver distribution can be found in 3 subdirectories:

[.DRIVER]   The Xscreensaver and Xscreensaver-command programs.
[.HACKS]    Graphic demos ,can be run either through the xscreensaver program 
            or standalone.
[.UTILS]    A small libraries of various utilities.

All objets, libraries and exes files in [.UTILS] and [.HACKS] directories are 
provided for VAX VMS 5.5-2 (compiled with VAX C 3.2 / Motif 1.1) or 
VAX VMS 6.1 (compiled with DEC C 5.0/ Motif 1.2) and Alpha VMS 6.1 
(compiled  with DEC C 5.0 / Motif 1.2). But the code in [.DRIVER] directory
cannot compile with Motif 1.1; objs and exe files are provided for VAX VMS 6.1
/ Motif 1.2 (compiled with VAX C 3.2 & DEC C 5.0).

XSCREENSAVER 1.26 needs at least DECW/Motif 1.2 either on VAX and Alphas (to 
have X11R5 libraries). The only module needing X11R5 is [.DRIVER]LOCK.C , if
somebody can remove this restriction, go on !!

If you wan to rebuild, you need to rebuild [.UTILS] directory first and
re-create the object library (look at the end of COMPILE*.COM procedure).

You can now rebuild the [.HACKS] directory and the [.DRIVER] directory.

WARNING : before rebuilding [.HACKS], you need to correct some of DECwindows 
bitmap files. Some files are bogus !! (they have a long line of null chars 
at the end). These files are under SYS$COMMON:[DECW$INCLUDE.BITMAPS] directory:

STIPPLE.XBM
HLINES2.XBM
LIGHT_GRAY.XBM
ROOT_WEAVES.XBM
VLINES2.XBM

These files are all used by Greynetic demo.

Nota: link procedure automagically select appropriate X and Motif Libraries
(X11R4/Motif 1.1 - X11R4/Motif 1.2). Really usefull only for graphic hacks
however ...

The SETUP.COM procedure gives you a definition of all DCL foreign command
symbols needed to run Xscreensaver and all the graphic hacks. You need to
modify this procedure if you install these programs in another directory tree.

VMS .HLP files are provied for all programms of this distribution.

You can easily add new graphic demos without recompiling Xscreensaver. You just
need to add them in resource file XSCREENSAVER.DAT. This file (originally
present in [.DRIVER] directory ) can be installed under your SYS$LOGIN 
directory for a per-user customization basis. You can also install it under 
the system-wide user resource directory SYS$COMMON:[DECW$DEFAULT.USER] 
(with (W:RE) protections). The new graphics hack must be run in root-window 
mode to be accepted by Xscreensaver.

The graphic demos are spawn into subprocess created by the system() call (in
the Unix version the execve() call is used).

The VMS passord checking programs were picked up in the Xlock distribution.

Many thanks to Martin P.J. Zinser for many portability improvements to this
port (look at XSCREEN_MARTIN.TXT for a list of changes).

Thanks to Grégoire Sandré (sandre@clamart.wireline.slb.com) for a patch
concerning FileVue X Messages.

Enjoy,
