       xxlloocckk locks the X server till the user enters their  pass-
       word  at  the  keyboard.   While xxlloocckk is running, all new
       server connections are refused.  The screen saver is  dis-
       abled.   The  mouse  cursor  is turned off.  The screen is
       blanked and a changing pattern is put on the screen.  If a
       key or a mouse button is pressed then the user is prompted
       for the password of the user who started xxlloocckk.

       If the correct password  is  typed,  then  the  screen  is
       unlocked  and  the  X server is restored.  When typing the
       password Control-U and Control-H are active  as  kill  and
       erase respectively.  To return to the locked screen, click
       in the small icon version of the changing pattern.

       In the lower part of the password screen a message is dis-
       played.   This message is taken from the first file of the
       following that exists:  $HOME/.xlockmessage,  $HOME/.plan,
       or $HOME/.signature.

       _X_l_o_c_k should not be used on public terminals when there is
       a high demand for them.

       If you find a public terminal  that  has  been  locked  by
       another  user  and there are no other terminals available,
       and the terminal appears to have  been  left  idle  for  a
       while  (normally  more than 15 minutes), it is fair to try
       to reset the session in some manner.

            to delay between batches  of  animations.   In  blank
            mode,  it is important to set this to some small num-
            ber of seconds, because the keyboard  and  mouse  are
            only  checked after each delay, so you cannot set the
            delay too high, but a delay of zero would  needlessly
            consume  cpu checking for mouse and keyboard input in
            a tight loop, since blank mode has no work to do.

            In  sproingies it is the size of the screen.  A nega-

       --ssaattuurraattiioonn _v_a_l_u_e
            The  _s_a_t_u_r_a_t_i_o_n  option  sets saturation of the color
            ramp used to _v_a_l_u_e _.  0 is grayscale and  1  is  very
            rich color.  0.4 is a nice pastel.

       ++//--nnoolloocckk
            The  _n_o_l_o_c_k option causes xxlloocckk to only draw the pat-
            terns and not lock the display.  A  key  press  or  a
            mouse click will terminate the screen saver.

       --//++iinnwwiinnddooww
            Runs  xxlloocckk  in  a  window,  so that you can iconify,
            move, or resize it and  still  use  your  screen  for
            other  stuff.   When  running  in  a window, xxlloocckk no
            longer locks your screen, it just looks good.

            option  it  no longer locks the screen, it just looks
            good.

       --//++rreemmoottee
            The _r_e_m_o_t_e option tells xxlloocckk to not  stop  you  from
            locking  remote  X11  servers.  This option should be
            used with care and is intended  mainly  to  lock  X11
            terminals  which  cannot  run  xxlloocckk locally.  If you
            lock someone else's workstation, they  will  have  to

            overrides any resource derived values for _r_e_m_o_t_e  and
            prevents  xxlloocckk  from  being  used  to lock other X11
            servers.   (Use  `+'  instead  of  `-'  to   override
            resources  for  other  options  that can take the `+'
            modifier similarly.)

       --//++mmoonnoo
            The _m_o_n_o option causes xxlloocckk to  display  monochrome,
            (black and white) pixels rather than the default col-
            ored ones on color displays.

       --//++aalllloowwaacccceessss
            This option is required  for  servers  which  do  not
            allow clients to modify the host access control list.
            It is also useful if you need to run x clients  on  a
            server  which  is  locked  for  some  reason...  When
            _a_l_l_o_w_a_c_c_e_s_s is true, the X11 server is left open  for
            clients  to attach and thus lowers the inherent secu-
            rity of this lock screen.  A  side  effect  of  using
            this  option  is  that  if xxlloocckk is killed -KILL, the
            access control list is not lost.

       --//++aalllloowwrroooott
            The _a_l_l_o_w_r_o_o_t option  allows  the  root  password  to
            unlock  the  server  as  well as the user who started
            xxlloocckk.  May not be able  to  turn  this  on  and  off
            depending  on  your  system and how xxlloocckk was config-
            ured.

       --//++ddeebbuugg
            Allows xxlloocckk to be debugged by doing all but  locking
            the screen.

       --//++eecchhookkeeyyss
            The  _e_c_h_o_k_e_y_s option causes xxlloocckk to echo '?' charac-
            ters for each key typed  into  the  password  prompt.
            Some consider this a security risk, so the default is
            to not echo anything.

       --//++eennaabblleessaavveerr
            By default xxlloocckk will disable the normal  X  server's
            screen  saver since it is in effect a replacement for
            it.  Since it is possible  to  set  delay  parameters
            long  enough to cause phosphor burn on some displays,
            this option will turn  back  on  the  default  screen
            saver  which  is  very  careful  to  keep most of the
            screen black.

       --//++ggrraabbmmoouussee
            The _g_r_a_b_m_o_u_s_e option causes xxlloocckk to grab  the  mouse
            and  keyboard,  this  is  the default.  xxlloocckk can not
            lock the screen without this.

            The _u_s_e_f_i_r_s_t option causes xxlloocckk to use the keystroke
            which  got  you  to  the password screen as the first
            character in the password.  The default is to  ignore
            the first key pressed.

       xxlloocckk can appear to hang if it is competing with  a  high-
       priority  process  for  the  CPU. For example, if xxlloocckk is
       started after a process with 'nice -20'  (high  priority),
       xxlloocckk will take  considerable amount of time to respond.

       If  the  machine  is  using a shadow password system, then
       xxlloocckk may not be set up to get the real  password  and  so
       must  be  given  one of its own. This can be either on the
       command line, via the --ccppaasssswwdd  option,  or  in  the  file
       $$HHOOMMEE//..xxlloocckkrrcc, with the first taking precedence.  In both
       cases an encrypted password is expected (see  makekey(8)).
       If neither is given, then xxlloocckk will prompt for a password
       and will use that, also storing an encrypted version of it
       in $$HHOOMMEE//..xxlloocckkrrcc for future use.

       "kill  -KILL  xxlloocckk " causes the server that was locked to
       be unusable, since all hosts  (including  localhost)  were
       removed  from  the  access  control list to lock out new X
       clients, and since xxlloocckk could not catch SIGKILL, it  ter-
       minated  before  restoring  the access control list.  This
       will leave the X server in  a  state  where  _"_y_o_u  _c_a_n  _n_o

       the X11R4 Xlib Documentation, Chapter 7.
       NCD  terminals  do not allow xlock to remove all the hosts
       from the access control list.  Therefore you will need  to
       use  the  "-remote"  and  "-allowaccess" switches.  If you
       happen to run without "-allowaccess" on an  NCD  terminal,
       xxlloocckk will not work and you will need to reboot the termi-
       nal, or simply go into the  SETUP  menus,  under  'Network
       Parameters', and turn off TCP/IP access control.
